                    <p>TigerTickets: TigerTickets is a centralized platform that allows 
                        Princeton University students and staffs to buy, sell, and exchange 
                        tickets. It is a final project for COS333: Advanced Programming 
                        Techniques taught by Professor Robert Dondero in Spring 2020.</p>

                    <p>This is arguably one of the most interesting, complex, yet personal project to me. 
                        It was a project built with a simple goal: to address the demand for a ticket exchange
                        platform amongst Princeton studnets. I was the project leader in a team of three students, 
                        and it was a project that definitely taught me so much about UI/UX design and web applications.
                        Our team of three worked on this project for more than 8 weeks, using many different tools: 
                        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript (jQuery), Flask, CAS, MIME Internet email protocol, 
                        Python, Postgres, and finally the application is deployed on Heroku. 
                        Due to security reasons (to ensure that this platform is only accessible to anyone with a
                        Princeton login), the full website is not available without CAS login. But if by any chance
                        you are reading this and is a Princeton student/staff/alum, please check out our website
                        using the link below.

                    <p>IgniteSTEM Mobile Application: IgniteSTEM is a student-run, 
                        nonprofit organization with the goal of empowering K-12 educators 
                        with the skills, resources, and networks they need to implement 
                        project based learning in public schools. The IgniteSTEM mobile app is an
                        application built to support IgniteSTEM conferences. Attendees can 
                        download the app before or during the conference in order to view the 
                        scheduled events, signup for certain events with capacity limits, and 
                        view the supporting documents for each workshop.</p>
