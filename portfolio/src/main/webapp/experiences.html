                    <p>I am currently a STEP intern working with the Cloud Java Frameworks team. 
                        Through this internship, I hope to learn more
                        about other languages/techniques/frameworks commonly used in web applications. 
                        For me, this summer is my rite of passage into software engineering professionalism. 
                        I am excited to share this journey with my podmates, and place trust and confidence 
                        in each other as we strive together to write quality software. </p>
