                            <h4>First Day at Google</h4>
                            <p>Today is my first day as a Google STEP intern! I am so excited to start this internship 
                                and even though the internship format was changed, I still hope to learn many things this summer.
                                This internship structure is very interesting because in the semester that just ended I had just taken
                                a course in web development. It was a survey course that touched upon many different aspects of web 
                                programming, but the whole course was very Python oriented. Through this internship, I hope to learn more
                                about other languages/techniques/frameworks commonly used in web applications. 
                                Can't wait to start the capstone project!</p>

                            <h4>First Day at Tezign</h4>
                            <p>Hi everyone! I’m Jenny, a freshman BSE cos major, and this is my first blog post! This summer 
                                I will be interning with Tezign as a tech intern in product management and R&D, specifically 
                                in the AI Marketing PM team. I feel that after a week of work at Tezign it’s about the right 
                                time for me to write this journal entry, because things have sort of started to get into a routine, 
                                and it's a good place for me to stop and reflect on my experiences so far. I’ve been interested 
                                in entrepreneurship and startups for a long time, so I thought that the Princeton Startup Immersion programming
                                 would be a great way to experience the startup atmosphere. Besides 
                                learning technical skills related to software engineering, I really hope to learn more about what 
                                being a software engineer in a startup meant, and some of the product management aspects of a startup. 
                                As a cs major there are many different career paths to take, so I see this internship as an 
                                opportunity to experience the breadth of paths in startup companies as well as learn more technical 
                                skills. </p>
                                <p>There are many other interns at Tezign as well, and throughout the week I was 
                                kind of impressed at the rate that the company is expanding. Almost every other day 
                                some new intern or employee would be added to the group chat. I also attended one of the product 
                                management meetings, and it was my first company meeting at Tezign. During the meeting I was surprised 
                                that although the manager who was leading the meeting spoke regularly, she did not mind at all when some 
                                other coworker cut her off to express their ideas. Everyone was freely discussing and sharing their ideas. 
                                </p>
                                <p>I arrived a week before they were about to move location. Tezign is at max capacity and about to 
                                    move to a newer, bigger location. But even though this would mean that I would have a longer 
                                    commute, I look forward to spending the rest of my summer at Tezign. </p>
